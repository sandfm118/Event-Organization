Event Contract: A Solidity Smart Contract for Event Management

Introduction

This smart contract, named EventContract, is implemented in Solidity and facilitates the creation, ticketing, and management of events on a blockchain network.

Key Features

Event Creation: Users can create new events by specifying the event name, date, ticket price (in Wei), and total ticket count.
Ticket Purchasing: Users can purchase tickets for an event using Ether payments. The contract ensures sufficient funds and ticket availability for the purchase.
Ticket Transfer: Users can transfer purchased tickets to other addresses, allowing ownership changes before the event.

Important Notes

The provided code snippet contains a typo in the transferTicket function. The extra semicolon (tickets[msg.sender][id] >= quantity;) has been removed.
This is a simplified example and may require further development and security considerations for real-world applications.
